## React-App-Hacker-News

[React-App-Hacker-News](https://wladislaw28.github.io/react-model-api-hacher-news/) - This React application implements the news list from the open API Hacher News (https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1). As well as in this application, there is a search by news, selection by the number of pages on the main screen, as well as pagination.
Application created for educational purposes. Thanks for the idea and implementation - YauhenKavalchuk
